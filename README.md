AFM and AFM+S in Python
=======================

This is a python implementation of afm and afm+s, wherever possible I tried to
maintain scikit-learn convention, so that the code would be compatible with
their helper functions.

custom\_logistic.py is an estimator that can be used to implement AFM.
bounded\_logistic.py is an estimator that can be used to implement AFM+S.

process\_datashop.py can be used to read a student step export from datashop
and to run AFM and AFM+S on it.
